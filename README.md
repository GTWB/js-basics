# JavaScript Basics

This repository contains a series of JavaScript exercises covering fundamental concepts such as:

- Variables and Functions
- Arrays and Objects
- map(), filter(), reduce()
- async/await and Promises

Each folder contains individual exercises with commented code.

# 01 – Variables & Functions

Small exercises demonstrating variables, functions (regular & arrow), template strings,
input validation, and simple operations.

# 02 – Arrays

Exercises covering creation, manipulation and iteration of arrays in JavaScript.

# 03 – Objects

Exercises covering object creation, property manipulation, and object methods in JavaScript.

# 04 – Array Methods

Exercises covering the use of forEach, map, filter, and reduce in JavaScript.
Each block demonstrates data transformation patterns relevant for QA automation (e.g., parsing API responses and computing summaries).

## Topics

- forEach: iteration without return
- map: transformation, returns new array
- filter: conditional selection
- reduce: aggregation

## Run

Go inside the folder and type the following command on the terminal:
node file-name.js
